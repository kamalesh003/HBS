Minor Gaps Noted:
❓ Power-of-Two Constraints: Implementation assumes n is even but doesn't enforce power-of-two sizes that some butterfly algorithms prefer

❓ Advanced Sketching: Could add TensorSketch or other advanced sketching methods beyond simple linear projection

❓ Pattern Learning: Butterfly patterns are learned but initial patterns aren't explicitly discussed

❓ Memory Optimization: No explicit memory-efficient backward pass for very large n
